potentially useful for hijacking and modifying running processes in os x. this can be used for both good and evil. an example of good would be creating a profiler to track how many times a function is called in a project you don't have the source to. a bad reason would be to create malware, or for game hacking.

the idea is to use the dynamic linker (dlopen) to add executable code (from a dynamic library, or .dylib, analogous to .dll) to the process's executable memory. after the code is loaded, a running process is paused and it's state stored. a new stack frame is created and executed which calls a function in the newly mapped dylib. after our code is loaded and does what we want, control can be returned to the original process by reloading the old stack frame, or whatever.

i wrote this years ago and checked it into github just because. i never finished it but got it part of the way there. leaving it here in case someone wants to look at it. so far, it's able to find the location of dlopen() and store some of the state of the existing process. last i remember, i had some trouble with os x's ptrace, which is the heart of debugging tools (can pause and step thru processes). there are ways to attach processes and store their state because other people have made similar tools, and gdb obviously works on os x. i got bored and left it alone. have fun h4x0rs
